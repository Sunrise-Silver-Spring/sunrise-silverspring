Weâ€™re building a movement of young people to stop the climate crisis and create millions of good jobs in the process. We seek to end the corrupting influence of fossil fuel billionaires on our politics and elect leaders who stand up for the health and well-being of all people. We fight for aggressive, transformative policy that will transition our country to clean energy in a just way that stops current, prevents future, and repairs historic oppression of marginalized communities.</description></item></channel></rss>
