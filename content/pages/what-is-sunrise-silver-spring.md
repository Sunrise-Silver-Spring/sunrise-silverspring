We’re building a movement of young people to stop the climate crisis and create millions of good jobs in the process. We seek to end the corrupting influence of fossil fuel billionaires on our politics and elect leaders who stand up for the health and well-being of all people. We fight for aggressive, transformative policy that will transition our country to clean energy in a just way that stops current, prevents future, and repairs historic oppression of marginalized communities. We want to welcome all people into the Silver Spring Sunrise hub. We welcome people of all races, class backgrounds, sexual orientations, gender identities, faiths, immigration statuses, abilities, levels of organizing experience, and much more. We all come from diverse communities and have unique experiences. It’s important we acknowledge this in order to build a strong multiracial and cross-class movement. Whoever you are, we’re so glad you’re here.
